1. Explain what OpenMP is, what are it’s benefits?
	OpenMP is a multithreading and shared process api that can be
	used in C, C++ and FORTRAN. It allows for easy use of threads
	that automatically execute in parallel using safe handling
	of critical resources.
2. What are the #pragma ​definitions, what do they do?
	A standardized form of comments that are read by the compiler.
	The compiler then takes the pragma syntax and uses that to 
	compile code that corresponds to the syntax.
3. Write the OpenMP #pragma definition to execute a loop in parallel.
	#pragma omp parallel for
	{ ... }
4. What does the reduction​ do in the #pragma definition in OpenMP?
	The reduction creates private copies of the list variables for 
	each thread created. After all the threads are done executing,
	the reduction combines each private copy and reduces them into
	a single variable.
5. Explain the critical ​and private()​ declarations used in OpenMP.
	Critical denotes a critical section of the code for a thread,
	and automatically handles locks for each thread. Private() 
	creates a seperate copy of each variable in the list for
	every thread. For example private(x), will create copies of x 
	defined as x_1,...,x_n for n threads, where each x_i belongs
	to thread i and is a copy of x exclusive to that thread.
