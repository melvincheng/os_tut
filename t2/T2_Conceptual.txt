1. What are some of the benefits of the C language? Name an example where the
C language is used (hint there are many!).
Some benefits of the C langauge is that it is highly portable as a program written in C can run on different computers with little to no change. Another benefit of the C language is that there are a large number of libraries. C is used in OS and many fundamental software systems, such as UNIX and LINUX.

4. Name 5 header files from the C library and explain their purpose.
stdio.h - Basic input/output operations in a program
math.h - Includes basic math operations
stdlib.h - Is the standard template library for c functions
float.h - Include basic type conversion operations and float-type functions
string.h - Includes basic string conversion and string-type operations/functions

5. Lookup one function from each of the header files and put down the function
name and describe what it does.
stdlib.h    atoi()      Converts string to integer
stdio.h     printf()    outputs formatted string into stdout
math.h      sqrt()      Calculates square root
string.h    strcat()    Concatenates 2 strings
time.h      time()      Current time in seconds from January 1 1970
